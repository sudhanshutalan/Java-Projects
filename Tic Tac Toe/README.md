# Tic Tac Toe in Java
This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Java, where two players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 board. The game ends when one player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is filled with marks without a winner.

## Usage
- To play the game, simply run the TicTacToe class in your Java IDE or command line.
- You will see an empty board with a prompt for the first player to enter their move. 
- Enter the row and column numbers (0-2) for your mark, and the game will update the board and prompt the other player to make their move. 
- The game will continue until there is a winner or a draw, at which point the program will display the final board and exit.
